    <h1> chocolate lava cake</h1>
    <p> rich, indulgent taste,
        mood-boosting qualities, versatility in desserts,
        and satisfying, comforting sweetness.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients List </h2>
    <p><li>1. 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter</li>
    <li> 4 oz (113g) semi-sweet or dark chocolate (chopped)</li>
    <li> 1 cup (120g) powdered sugar</li>
    <li> 2 large eggs</li>
    <li> 2 large egg yolks</li>
    <li> 1/4 cup (32g) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li> 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li></p>



    <h2> Instruction </h2>
    <p>
        <ol> 1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
        Grease 4–6 small ramekins (depending on size) with butter or cooking spray.
        Lightly dust them with cocoa powder to prevent sticking.</ol>
        <ol> 2. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter and chopped chocolate.
            Microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring after each, until smooth.
            Alternatively, you can melt the mixture in a heatproof bowl over simmering water (double boiler method).</ol>
        <ol> 3. Add the powdered sugar to the melted chocolate mixture and whisk until well combined.</ol>
        <ol> 4. Whisk in the eggs and egg yolks until the mixture is smooth and shiny.</ol>
        <ol> 5. Gently stir in the flour, vanilla extract (optional), and a pinch of salt.
            Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</ol>
        <ol> 6. Evenly divide the batter between the prepared ramekins, filling each about 3/4 full.</ol>
        <ol> 7. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 12–14 minutes,
            or until the edges are firm but the centers are still soft and slightly jiggly. The tops should be set.</ol>
        <ol> 8. Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1–2 minutes.
            Carefully run a knife around the edges to loosen the cakes, then invert them onto serving plates.</ol>
        <ol> 9. Serve immediately with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, fresh berries, or a dollop of whipped cream.</ol>

    <h2> Tips & Variations</h2>
    <p>
        <ol> Don’t Overbake: Keep an eye on the cakes. The edges should be firm,
        but the center should still be slightly jiggly for that molten effect.</ol>
        <ol> Make Ahead: You can prepare the batter and refrigerate it in the ramekins for up to a day in advance.
            Just bake when ready, adding 1–2 extra minutes.</ol>
        <ol> Grease Well: Grease and dust the ramekins with cocoa powder
            to ensure the cakes release smoothly without sticking.</ol>
        <ol> Chocolate Flavor Varieties: Use milk chocolate for a sweeter taste,
            or go for dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher) for a richer, more intense flavor.</ol>
        <ol> Filled Lava Cakes: Add a surprise center by inserting a square of caramel,
            peanut butter, or white chocolate into the middle of the batter before baking.</ol>
        <ol> Flavored Lava Cakes: Add a teaspoon of instant espresso powder for a mocha twist or
            a dash of cinnamon for a spiced flavor. Infuse the batter with liqueurs like Baileys,
            Grand Marnier, or Kahlua for an adult version.</ol>
